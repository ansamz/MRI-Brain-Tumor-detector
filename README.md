## Project Intro/Objective
This project aims to provide a tool for accurate and efficient brain cancer diagnosis by leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms in predicting the type of tumor, glioma, meningioma, no-tumor, pituitary.
MRI scans have become an indispensable tool for diagnosing various types of cancer, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors. However, manual analysis of MRI images is time-consuming, error-prone, and heavily relies on the expertise of radiologists.
To overcome these limitations, we will try to make use of deep learning models that can automatically detect cancer and classify its type based on MRI images.
This repository contains code for preprocessing MRI images, training, testing, and evaluating deep learning models. I also use transfer learning on pre-trained models.
